PDB entry (provide 4 letter code, end with .pdb, example 3BWM.pdb):
Seed residue(s) (provide chainID, residueID, seperate multiple residues with ',', example A:300,A:301,A:302):
Program to be used to generate RIN and residue ranking (selection among probe/arpeggio/fsapt/distance, example probe or distance/5.0):
List residue(s) needs to be added specifically (provide chainID, residueID, n-term/c-term/sidechain/entire, example c+s or n+s or n+c or entire):
Models to be generated (All as the default, or only the maximal, example maximal):
Program to be used to run calculations (selection among gaussian/xtb/qchem, and please revise input template for specific level of theory and settings):
