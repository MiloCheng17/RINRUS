### PDB entry (provide 4 letter code, end with .pdb, example 3BWM.pdb):
### Seed residue(s) (provide chainID, residueID, seperate multiple residues with ',', example A:300,A:301,A:302):
### Program to be used to generate RIN and residue ranking (selection among probe/arpeggio/manual(customized res_atoms)/distance, example probe or distance/5.0):
### List residue(s) needs to be added specifically (provide chainID, residueID, n-term/c-term/sidechain/entire, example c+s or n+s or n+c or entire):
### Models to be generated (All as the default, or only the maximal, example maximal):
### Charge of the substrate+cofactor (example: +1)
### Program to be used to run calculations (selection among gaussian/xtb/qchem, and please revise input template for specific level of theory and settings):



PDB: 2cht.pdb
Seed: A:203
RIN_program: probe 
skip_reduce: false ###Default = false
Residue_to_add: A:299:c+s,A:120:n+s #### must have residues to be added in all (need to figure out, how c+n+s+c etc work)
### Histidine:  ##histidine have different protonation style by reduce, so this flag can be used for that purpose, two keyword can be used: one to not flip histidine in reduce, second to allow user to double protonation
Model(s): all
Substrate(s)_charge: -2 ## may be we need to explain how this calculated
Multiplicity: 3
residues_not_to_protonate: A:301,A:302  ##pymol ignore residue protonation
seed_residues_want_to_freeze: A:301,A:302    ##all seed by default either freeze or unfreeze, by using this flag user can reverse that freezing pattern
Computational_program: gaussian

## need driver in mut and output in terminal save to one file and should not overwrite if we run same thing again(this will be the log file)
## before it makes model show the residue tree of all model in terminal ( print freq per res)
##need error message if anywhere it does not match flag command e.g. avg>acg , mass>mas , A:203>A203 how it can recognize wrong terminal inputs or driver_input entries
##can we add all basing required distance question in driver input only, same for Arpeggio.etc in future to save more user entries after driver starts
