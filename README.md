# RINRUS
Residue Interaction Network-based ResidUe Selector (RINRUS) is a QM-cluster model building tool which starts from a raw PDB file. After seriers procedures, important residues for certain chemical reactions will be selected and trimmed PDB files as well as quantum mechanics (QM) input files will be generated.
